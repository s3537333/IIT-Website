								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interest in IT.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am interested in learning the basics of Informations Technology as it may be useful in my Business Management degree especially for e-commerce. Although I have little knowledge and experience in regards to IT, I am interested in learning more as it might be helpful once I graduate and enter the workforce. I chose to come to RMIT for my degree as it is one of the top universities in Melbourne.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Job Advertisement.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This position appeals to me as I would be able to manage web content, prepare analysis and reports as well as assist with development of SEO and SEM campaigns. In addition to that, I would be able to actively contribute to the organisation by sharing ideas in brainstorming sessions. This job is great for me as I like to be proactive in the workplace to help the organisation achieve their goals.</p>
								<p>A degree in marketing or information technology or related science as well as knowledge of Google Analytics is a must for this job. Furthermore, an eye for detail is needed as any mistakes made could be costly for the organisation. In addition to that, previous experience in eCommerce is also required by the organisation as it will be helpful in balancing and prioritising in a fast-paced environment.</p>
								<p>I currently have little to no skills, knowledge or experience in this field as I am new to the course however I am hoping that after completing my degree, I would be suitably equipped to fulfill the requirements of the job.</p>
								<p>In order to better prepare myself in obtaining the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, I will ensure that I fully understand the knowledge obtained througout the duration of my degree as I am confident that by the end of the ocourse, I will be ready to enter the workforce and apply for the position offered as an e-Commerce Marketing Manager.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Learning Style Test.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Big Five Personality Test.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> According to the results of the Myer-Briggs test means that I would have to work harder to be more outspoken especially when working in groups. Communication skills should be a main focus for me in order to improve in order for me to better contribute to my group and organisation. Based on the Learning Style test, it shows that I have the highest score in tactile which would conclude that I am more of a hands-on learner thus my role in an organisation should be one in which I am required to be active physically in order for me to contribute my best performance to the organisation. Last but not least is the Big Five Personality test that I have undertaken shows that I scored the highest in emotional stability which would be an asset as I would have a higher self-control compared to others that would enable me to handle tough situations that might occur in the workplace. Thus as an employee, I can easily practice restraint and only reveal my emotions in a controlled and calm manner in order to avoid escalating a situation unnecessarily.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>

								<section>
									<h3 class="major">Overview and Motivation</h3>
									<p> The project idea will be to develop a smartphone app that would allows users to buy and sell high end luxury goods such as designer watches,clothes, bags, footwear, jewellery and other accessories. The industry's revenue has grown 9.1% annually and has a revenue of $2.2 billion spread across 240 businesses. This increase is due to a growing demand from inbound tourist which has boosted the demand in the industry. Furthermore, Australia has a high number of international students with a majority of it being Chinese students from mainland China which is also a contributing factor in the booming of the luxury goods industry in Australia. According to an article published by the South China Morning Post, Chinese students and tourists are responsible for two thirds of luxury retail sales in Mebourne and Sydney. Therefore, it can be a market to tap into in which retailers and customers are able to connect with each other virtually thus allowing customers the freedom of purchasing luxury products without having to leave their home. It can not only connect retailers with Australian customers but also international customers in order to broaden their customer base. Furthermore, in recent years, the development and advancement of technology has seen an increase in smartphone ownership especially those between the age of 12-24 years old as evidenced through Statistica where 95% of respondents had smartphones. Statistica also reported that the number of smartphone users has reached 2.32 billion as of 2017 with an expected increase to 2.87 billion by 2020. In addition to that, a survey conducted by Go-Globe which is a web design company based in Hong Kong where 72% of consumers think that mobile apps make shopping easier and are less time consuming and an average of 4.2 shopping apps is present in a smartphone.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p> The app will have several features including a push notification feature in order to regularly update our existing users about the latest products as well as exclusive offers and discounts.This feature would be beneficial as it increases sales and customer engagement. Furthermore, the app will introduce a loyalty scheme in order to attract new and retain existing customers.The app would offer points for every purchase which can in turn be exchangeable with e-vouchers for free delivery and discounts such as those offered by ASOS. Personalisation will aslo be offered through app settings to users as it can help in increasing custoemr experience as well as app value. Additionally, the app would offer 24/7 customer support by establishing strong communication with customers. Customer support will be offered through a chatbot or live chat with a staff member to help customers with any enquiries. Lastly, the app would have an easy payment feature in which customers can store their payment information in the app for future purchases in order to speed up transactions. Various payment method will be ofered such as credit card or debit card, Apple Pay, Paypal and many more.</p>
