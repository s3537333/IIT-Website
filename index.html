								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interest in IT.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am interested in learning the basics of Informations Technology as it may be useful in my Business Management degree especially for e-commerce. Although I have little knowledge and experience in regards to IT, I am interested in learning more as it might be helpful once I graduate and enter the workforce. I chose to come to RMIT for my degree as it is one of the top universities in Melbourne.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Job Advertisement.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This position appeals to me as I would be able to manage web content, prepare analysis and reports as well as assist with development of SEO and SEM campaigns. In addition to that, I would be able to actively contribute to the organisation by sharing ideas in brainstorming sessions. This job is great for me as I like to be proactive in the workplace to help the organisation achieve their goals.</p>
								<p>A degree in marketing or information technology or related science as well as knowledge of Google Analytics is a must for this job. Furthermore, an eye for detail is needed as any mistakes made could be costly for the organisation. In addition to that, previous experience in eCommerce is also required by the organisation as it will be helpful in balancing and prioritising in a fast-paced environment.</p>
								<p>I currently have little to no skills, knowledge or experience in this field as I am new to the course however I am hoping that after completing my degree, I would be suitably equipped to fulfill the requirements of the job.</p>
								<p>In order to better prepare myself in obtaining the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, I will ensure that I fully understand the knowledge obtained througout the duration of my degree as I am confident that by the end of the ocourse, I will be ready to enter the workforce and apply for the position offered as an e-Commerce Marketing Manager.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Big Five Personality Test.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> According to the results of the Myer-Briggs test means that I would have to work harder to be more outspoken especially when working in groups. Communication skills should be a main focus for me in order to improve in order for me to better contribute to my group and organisation. Based on the Learning Style test, it shows that I have the highest score in tactile which would conclude that I am more of a hands-on learner thus my role in an organisation should be one in which I am required to be active physically in order for me to contribute my best performance to the organisation. Last but not least is the Big Five Personality test that I have undertaken shows that I scored the highest in emotional stability which would be an asset as I would have a higher self-control compared to others that would enable me to handle tough situations that might occur in the workplace. Thus as an employee, I can easily practice restraint and only reveal my emotions in a controlled and calm manner in order to avoid escalating a situation unnecessarily.</p>

								<section>
									<h3 class="major">Overview and Motivation</h3>
									<p>The project idea will be to develop a smartphone app that would allows user to browse and purchase products such as clothings and accessories. This app would enable users to shop anywhere and at anytime with the product or products purchased being delivered to their doorstep. The app's target users would be between the ages of 12 -24 years old. According to Statistica, 95% of respondents between age 12-24 years reportedly owns a smartphone thus this is a huge market that can be tapped into. The shopping app can be used to regualrly update existing customers through push notifications which could contain exclusive offers and discounts. Furthermore, it is more convenient to have a shopping app as it enables you to purchase a desired product fast no matter where you are. This can be seen in a survey conducted by Go-Globe which is a web design company based in Hong Kong where 72% of consumers think that mobile apps make shopping easier and are less time consuming. In addition to that, Go-Globe found that there are an average of 4.2 shopping apps per smartphone owner which shows that there is great potential for a shopping app to be successful in the market.</p>
